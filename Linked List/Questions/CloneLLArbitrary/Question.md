Given a linked list with 2 pointers, one pointing to next node and other pointing to any random node in linked list. Write a logic to clone the linked list without original list being modified

**Methods**:
- Store next and arbitrary mappings of original list in an array. Modify original list tocreate copy and then restore original list

- Using constant extra space, create copy of 1st node and place between 1 and second node...and so onâ€¦ Then copy arbitrary link. Now restore original list and clone list by playing with pointers
