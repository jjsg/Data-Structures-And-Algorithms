MCQ

1. Which of the following is an advantage of adjacency list representation over adjacency matrix representation of a graph?
(A) In adjacency list representation, space is saved for sparse graphs.
(B) DFS and BSF can be done in O(V + E) time for adjacency list representation. These operations take O(V^2) time in adjacency matrix representation. Here is V and E are number of vertices and edges respectively.
(C) Adding a vertex in adjacency list representation is easier than adjacency matrix representation.
(D) All of the above

Ans: D


2. The degree sequence of a simple graph(no loops, no multiple edges) is the sequence of the degrees of the nodes in the graph in decreasing order. Which of the following sequences can not be the degree sequence of any graph?
I. 7, 6, 5, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1
II. 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2
III. 7, 6, 6, 4, 4, 3, 2, 2
IV. 8, 7, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1, 1 
(A) I and II
(B) III and IV
(C) IV only
(D) II and IV

Ans: D (II-> multiple edges, IV-> loop since 8 canâ€™t be degree in 7 vertex graph)


3. Consider an undirected unweighted graph G. Let a breadth-first traversal of G be done starting from a node r. Let d(r, u) and d(r, v) be the lengths of the shortest paths from r to u and v respectively, in G. lf u is visited before v during the breadth-first traversal, which of the following statements is correct? (GATE CS 2001)
(A) d(r, u) < d (r, v) 
(B) d(r, u) > d(r, v)
(C) d(r, u) <= d (r, v) 
(D) None of the above

Ans: C


4. Which of the following statements is/are TRUE for an undirected graph?
P: Number of odd degree vertices is even
Q: Sum of degrees of all vertices is even
(A) P Only
(B) Q Only
(C) Both P and Q
(D) Neither P nor Q

Ans: C
 

5. Given an undirected graph G with V vertices and E edges, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is
(A) E
(B) 2E
(C) V
(D) 2V

Ans: B


6. What is the maximum number of edges in an acyclic undirected graph with n vertices?
(A) n-1
(B) n
(C) n + 1
(D) 2n-1

Ans: A


7. Traversal of a graph is different from tree because
(A) There can be a loop in graph so we must maintain a visited flag for every vertex
(B) DFS of a graph uses stack, but inorrder traversal of a tree is recursive
(C) BFS of a graph uses queue, but a time efficient BFS of a tree is recursive.
(D) All of the above

Ans: A


8. The Breadth First Search algorithm has been implemented using the queue data structure. One possible order of visiting the nodes of the following graph is
    
         M------------N-----------O
       /  \          /           /
     /      \      /           /
   /          \  /           /
  R             Q-----------P

(A) MNOPQR
(B) NQMPOR
(C) QMNPRO
(D) QMNPOR

Ans: C


9. Given two vertices in a graph s and t, which of the two traversals (BFS and DFS) can be used to find if there is path from s to t?
(A) Only BFS
(B) Only DFS
(C) Both BFS and DFS
(D) Neither BFS nor DFS

Ans: C


10. Which of the following condition is sufficient to detect cycle in a directed graph?
(A) There is an edge from currently being visited node to an already visited node.
(B) There is an edge from currently being visited node to an ancestor of currently visited node in DFS forest.
(C) Every node is seen twice in DFS.
(D) None of the bove

Ans: B
