Create a data structure twoStacks that represents two stacks. Implementation of twoStacks should use only one array, i.e., both stacks should use the same array for storing elements. Following functions must be supported bytwoStacks: push and pop of element from stack

*Input*:

Push element into stack1

push element into stack2

pop element from stack1

pop element from stack2


*Output*:

element pushed into stack1

element pushed into stack2



__*Note*__: Logic should pass all possible testcases



**Methods**:
- Divide array into 2 halfs, and each half is one stack
- Two top at 2 exteremes, and both stacks will grow towards each other
