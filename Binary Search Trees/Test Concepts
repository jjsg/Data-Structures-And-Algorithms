2. In delete operation of BST, we need inorder successor (or predecessor) of a node when the node to be deleted has both left and right child as non-empty. Which of the following is true about inorder successor needed in delete operation?
(A) Inorder Successor is always a leaf node
(B) Inorder successor is always either a leaf node or a node with empty left child
(C) Inorder successor may be an ancestor of the node
(D) Inorder successor is always either a leaf node or a node with empty right child

Ans: B


3. We are given a set of n distinct elements and an unlabeled binary tree[structure] with n nodes. In how many ways can we populate the tree with the given set so that it becomes a binary search tree? (GATE CS 2011)
(A) 0

Ans: B


6. Suppose the numbers 7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2 are inserted in that order into an initially empty binary search tree. The binary search tree uses the usual ordering on natural numbers. What is the in-order traversal sequence of the resultant tree?
(A) 7 5 1 0 3 2 4 6 8 9
(B) 0 2 4 3 1 6 5 9 8 7
(C) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
(D) 9 8 6 4 2 3 0 1 5 7

Ans: C


7.  The following numbers are inserted into an empty binary search tree in the given order: 10, 1, 3, 5, 15, 12, 16. What is the height of the binary search tree (the height is the maximum distance of a leaf node from the root)? 
(A) 2
(B) 3
(C) 4
(D) 6

Ans: B


8. The preorder traversal sequence of a binary search tree is 30, 20, 10, 15, 25, 23, 39, 35, 42. Which one of the following is the postorder traversal sequence of the same tree?
(A) 10, 20, 15, 23, 25, 35, 42, 39, 30
(B) 15, 10, 25, 23, 20, 42, 35, 39, 30
(C) 15, 20, 10, 23, 25, 42, 35, 39, 30
(D) 15, 10, 23, 25, 20, 35, 42, 39, 30

Ans: D
