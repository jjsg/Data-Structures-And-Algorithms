Given a number n, write a function that generates and prints all binary numbers with decimal values from 1 to n. [Try without converting each decimal number to binary]

Input: 
5
Output: 
1 10 11 100 101


*Note*: Logic should pass all possible testcases


**Methods**:
- A simple method is to run a loop from 1 to n, call decimal to binary inside the loop
- Create an empty queue of strings
  Enqueue the first binary number “1” to queue.
  Now run a loop for generating and printing n binary numbers.
  - Dequeue and Print the front of queue.
  - Append “0” at the end of front item and enqueue it.
  - Append “1” at the end of front item and enqueue it.
