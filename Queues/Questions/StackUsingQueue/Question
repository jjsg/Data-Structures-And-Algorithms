Implement stack using queue. i.e. Only queue operations can be used enqueue(), dequeue(), front(), rear()

Input: 1 2 3 4 5 6 //Order in which elements are pushed in stack
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 //Order in which elements are removed from stack

*Note*: Logic should pass all possible testcases


**Methods**:
- Logic where push is costly (enqueue new element and re-enqueue all previous elements)
- Logic where pop is costly
