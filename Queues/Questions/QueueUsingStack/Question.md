Implement queue using stack. i.e. Only stack operations can be used push(), pop(), peek(), top()

Input: 1 2 3 4 5 6 //Order in which elements are enqueued in queue
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 //Order in which elements are dequeued in queue

*Note*: Logic should pass all possible testcases


**Methods**:
- Logic where enqueue is costly
- Logic where dequeue is costly
