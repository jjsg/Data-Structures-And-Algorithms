3. The keys 12, 18, 13, 2, 3, 23, 5 and 15 are inserted into an initially empty hash table of length 10 using open addressing with hash function h(k) = k mod 10 and linear probing. What is the resultant hash table?

0		0		0		0
1		1		1		1
2 - 2		2 - 12		2 - 12		2 - 12,2
3 - 23		3 - 13		3 - 13		3 - 13,3,23
4		4		4 - 2		4
5 - 15		5 - 5		5 - 3		5 - 5,15
6		6		6 - 23		6
7		7		7 - 5		7
8 - 18		8 - 18		8 - 18		8 - 18
9		9		9 - 15		9

A		B		C		D

4. Given the following input (4322, 1334, 1471, 9679, 1989, 6171, 6173, 4199) and the hash function x mod 10, which of the following statements are true?
i. 9679, 1989, 4199 hash to the same value
ii. 1471, 6171 has to the same value
iii. All elements hash to the same value
iv. Each element hashes to a different value
(A) i only
(B) ii only
(C) i and ii only
(D) iii or iv

Ans: C


5. Which one of the following hash functions on integers will distribute keys most uniformly over 10 buckets numbered 0 to 9 for i ranging from 0 to 2020?
(A) h(i) =i2 mod 10
(B) h(i) =i3 mod 10
(C) h(i) = (11 ∗ i2) mod 10
(D) h(i) = (12 ∗ i) mod 10

Ans: B [since in cube last digits are from 0-9]
