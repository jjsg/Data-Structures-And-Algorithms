 MCQ


1. What is the time complexity of Build Heap operation. Build Heap is used to build a max(or min) binary heap from a given array. Build Heap is used in Heap Sort as a first step for sorting.
(A) O(nLogn)
(B) O(n^2)
(C) O(Logn)
(D) O(n)

Ans: D


2. Suppose we are sorting an array of eight integers using heapsort, and we have just finished some heapify (either maxheapify or minheapify) operations. The array now looks like this:
16 14 15 10 12 27 28
How many heapify operations have been performed on root of heap?
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3 or 4
(D) 5 or 6

Ans: B


3. In a binary max heap containing n numbers, the smallest element can be found in time (GATE CS 2006)
(A) 0(n)
(B) O(logn)
(C) 0(loglogn)
(D) 0(1)

Ans: A


4. A 3-ary max heap is like a binary max heap, but instead of 2 children, nodes have 3 children. A 3-ary heap can be represented by an array as follows: The root is stored in the first location, a[0], nodes in the next level, from left to right, is stored from a[1] to a[3]. The nodes from the second level of the tree from left to right are stored from a[4] location onward. An item x can be inserted into a 3-ary heap containing n items by placing x in the location a[n] and pushing it up the tree to satisfy the heap property.
Which one of the following is a valid sequence of elements in an array representing 3-ary max heap?
(A) 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
(B) 9, 6, 3, 1, 8, 5
(C) 9, 3, 6, 8, 5, 1
(D) 9, 5, 6, 8, 3, 1

Ans: D


5. Suppose the elements 7, 2, 10 and 4 are inserted, in that order, into the valid 3- ary max heap found in the above question, Which one of the following is the sequence of items in the array representing the resultant heap?
(A) 10, 7, 9, 8, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6, 4
(B) 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
(C) 10, 9, 4, 5, 7, 6, 8, 2, 1, 3
(D) 10, 8, 6, 9, 7, 2, 3, 4, 1, 5

Ans: A


6. Consider a binary max-heap implemented using an array. Which one of the following array represents a binary max-heap? (GATE CS 2009)
(A) 25,12,16,13,10,8,14
(B) 25,12,16,13,10,8,14
(C) 25,14,16,13,10,8,12
(D) 25,14,12,13,10,8,16

Ans: C


7. What is the content of the array after two delete operations on the correct answer to the previous question?
(A) 14,13,12,10,8
(B) 14,12,13,8,10
(C) 14,13,8,12,10
(D) 14,13,12,8,10

Ans: D


8. We have a binary heap on n elements and wish to insert n more elements (not necessarily one after another) into this heap. The total time required for this is
(A) O(logn)
(B) O(n)
(C) O(nlogn)
(D) O(n2)

Ans: B
